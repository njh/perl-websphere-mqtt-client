WebSphere-MQTT-Client version 0.03
==================================

WebSphere::MQTT::Client is a perl module that talks:

	IBM's WebSphere MQ Telemetry Transport

to a broker.

It uses the C source code provided by IBM in SupportPac IA93, plus a new
Perl implementation of persistence.

This perl module is single threaded in the C code at the moment; this means
that if the remote address is a blackhole, the API can block for several
minutes while it attempts to connect.

LWT (Last Will and Testament) has also not been implemented.




INSTALLATION

	I use Module::Build to build and install the module.
	To install this module type the following:
	
		perl Build.PL
		./Build
		./Build test
		
	And then as root:
	
		./Build install

	Module::Build is available in the debian package:

		libmodule-build-perl
