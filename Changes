Revision history for Perl extension WebSphere::MQTT.


0.01  Sun Jul 25 01:07:29 2004
	First release
	
0.02  Mon Jul 17 13:46:00 2006
	<B.Candler@pobox.com>
	* Added publish capability
	* Added persistence wrapper and Perl persistence module
	* Added "async" connect option; allows publishing via persistence
	  layer even when remote MQ server is down. Note however this is
	  limited by API, in particular max. 65536 messages and a risk of
	  the same message ID being used twice.
	* Some sanity checking when processing received publications
	* Some fixes to compile cleanly with -Wall
    * Added Makefile.PL shim

0.03  Tue Nov 07 16:01:00 2006
	<B.Candler@pobox.com>
	* Fixed bug where receivePub croaked with 'OK'
	* xs_publish() now returns array of (status, message handle)
	* added xs_getMsgStatus() to check status of a given message
	* publish() now takes an optional callback function and argument
	  which is invoked when a QoS 1 or 2 message is delivered
	This is primarily so that if your messages are already locally
	queued, you can publish at QOS 1 without having to write them
	again to the persistence layer. You wait for successful delivery
	and then delete them from your own queue when done.
